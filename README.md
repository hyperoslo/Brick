## Description

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperoslo/Brick/master/Images/icon_v2.png" alt="Brick Icon" align="right" />

Brick is a generic view model for both basic and complex scenarios.
Mapping a basic table view cells is as easy as pie, if you have more properties, you can use the `meta` dictionary to add all additional properties that you might need. It also supports relations so that you can nest view models inside of view models.

```swift
public struct Item: Mappable {
  public var index = 0
  public var title = ""
  public var subtitle = ""
  public var text = ""
  public var image = ""
  public var kind = ""
  public var action: String?
  public var size = CGSize(width: 0, height: 0)
  public var meta = [String : AnyObject]()
}
```

- **.index**
Calculated value to determine the index it has inside of the component.
- **.title**
The headline for your data, in a `UITableViewCell` it is normally used for `textLabel.text` but you are free to use it as you like.
- **.subtitle**
Same as for the title, in a `UITableViewCell` it is normally used for `detailTextLabel.text`.
- **.text**
This is an optional property that can be used for larger amount of text needed to describe your `Item`
- **.image**
Can be either a URL string or a local string, you can easily determine if it should use a local or remote asset in your view.
- **.kind**
Is used for the `reuseIdentifier` of your `UITableViewCell` or `UICollectionViewCell`.
- **.action**
Action identifier for you to parse and process when a user taps on a list item. We recommend [Compass](https://github.com/hyperoslo/Compass) as centralized navigation system.
- **.size**
Can either inherit from the `UITableViewCell`/`UICollectionViewCell`, or be manually set by the height calculations inside of your view.
- **.meta**
This is used for extra data that you might need access to inside of your view, it can be a hex color, a unique identifer or additional images for your view.

## Usage

```swift
let item = Item(
  title: "John Hyperseed",
  subtitle: "Build machine",
  meta: [
    "operatingSystem" : "OS X",
    "xcodeVersion" : 7.3
])

print(item.meta("operatingSystem", "")) // prints "OS X"
print(item.meta("xcodeVersion", 0.0)) // prints 7.3

```
